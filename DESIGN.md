Today (M0): the command/event model, the text format and the `Queue` trait. No queue
implementation yet; M1 adds the reference queue.

## Decisions

### D1: Language: Rust
- **Alternatives:** Go (the usual choice for brokers and Raft: etcd, NATS, Temporal), Java/Kotlin (Kafka).
- **Why:** same toolchain and workflow as lsmkv, lob and ember (cargo, clippy, proptest, criterion),
  and no data races to chase in the network and replication layers. Go would be the industry
  default and its runtime makes the network edge shorter to write, but the core here is a
  single-threaded state machine where Rust's ownership and enums do most of the work, and a
  garbage collector would only show up later as tail latency in the M11 benchmarks.

### D2: Our own broker and storage
- **What:** spool owns its queue state, its write-ahead log (M2) and its replication (M6). No
  Redis, Postgres, Kafka or SQS underneath.
- **Alternatives:** a Celery/Sidekiq-style layer over Redis lists, or a Postgres
  `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` queue.
- **Why:** a wrapper delegates every hard question (what happens to a leased job when the node
  crashes, when the network splits, when a worker stalls past its timeout) to the store underneath,
  so there is nothing of ours to test or defend. Owning the state machine, the log and the
  replication is what makes those questions ours. The Postgres design is the right production
  answer for many teams and gets mentioned in the README as the baseline we are not building.

### D3: At-least-once delivery, effectively-once processing
- **What:** a job may be delivered more than once (a lease expires while the worker is still
  running, an ack is lost on the way back). Duplicate *effects* are prevented inside a stated
  boundary by three mechanisms: idempotency keys on enqueue (M3), fencing tokens on every lease (M4),
  and a transactional ack that records the job's result and the ack in one log record (M4).
- **Alternatives:** at-most-once (ack on delivery, lose jobs on worker crash); claiming
  "exactly-once delivery".
- **Why:** exactly-once *delivery* is impossible with crashing workers and an unreliable network:
  a worker that dies after its side effect but before its ack is indistinguishable from one that
  died before the side effect. What can be built is exactly-once *effect* on state the queue
  controls (or state that checks fencing tokens). That is what Kafka's "exactly-once" and SQS FIFO
  deduplication actually provide, and spool states the boundary explicitly and tests it with
  worker crashes (M4) and partitions (M9).

### D4: Pure state machine with logical time
- **What:** the queue is `apply(&Command) -> Events` with no clock, no randomness, no I/O and no
  dependence on `HashMap` iteration order. The current time arrives inside every command. Tokio,
  sockets and files live only at the edge.
- **Alternatives:** an async broker that reads `Instant::now()` and spawns timers per lease.
- **Why:** a deterministic core is what makes everything after M1 testable. Recovery replays the
  log and reaches the same state (M2). Raft replicas apply the same committed commands and stay
  identical, which only works if `apply` depends on nothing but the command (M7). The simulator
  can run thousands of seeded failure schedules and replay any failing one exactly (M5). Lease
  expiry becomes a pure function of the time in the command, so "the worker stalled for 31 s"
  is a test input rather than a sleep. FoundationDB and TigerBeetle are built this way.

### D5: Leases with visibility timeouts and fencing tokens
- **What:** leasing a job hides it from other workers until a deadline. The worker extends the
  deadline with heartbeats. A lease that reaches its deadline expires and the job becomes
  leasable again. Failed jobs retry with backoff and move to a dead-letter queue after a maximum
  number of attempts (M1). Every lease carries a fencing token that increases on every lease, and
  heartbeat, ack and nack must present the current token.
- **Alternatives:** SQS-style receipt handles without ordering; locks held by a connection
  (job is released when the TCP connection drops).
- **Why:** connection-bound locks fail exactly when it matters: a network partition keeps the
  worker alive while the broker sees the connection drop, and a stalled worker (GC pause, swap)
  keeps its connection while doing nothing. A deadline is the only signal the broker can rely on.
  But a deadline alone allows a zombie: worker A stalls, its lease expires, worker B leases the
  job, then A wakes up and acks. The fencing token closes that: A's token is older than B's, so
  A's ack is rejected, and downstream stores that check the token reject A's writes too
  (Kleppmann's fencing argument against Redlock).

### D6: Replication: Raft written from scratch (Tier 2)
- **What:** each partition is a Raft group whose log carries queue commands; the state machine
  from D4 applies committed entries.
- **Alternatives:** an existing Raft crate (openraft, raft-rs); primary/backup with a lease;
  leaderless replication; Paxos.
- **Why:** a queue needs a single order of operations per partition (two workers must never
  both lease the same job), which is consensus, and Raft is the consensus protocol designed to be
  explained and implemented. Writing it ourselves is the point of the project: election safety,
  log matching and commit rules are what distributed-systems interviews probe, and only our own
  implementation can be run inside our simulator (M5) with full control over every message.
  Primary/backup without consensus loses acknowledged jobs on failover under partition.

### D7: Partition testing: deterministic simulation plus a history checker
- **What:** M5 runs whole clusters in one thread with a simulated network, disk and clock, all
  driven by one seed, injecting drops, delays, reordering, partitions, crashes and torn writes.
  Every run records a history of client operations and results, and a Jepsen-style checker
  (M9) verifies it: no acknowledged job lost, no job's effect applied twice, linearizable
  operations on small histories. M10 repeats the same checks on real processes behind a
  fault-injecting proxy.
- **Alternatives:** only real processes with Jepsen-style fault injection; only unit tests.
- **Why:** real-process testing finds bugs but cannot reproduce them: the failing interleaving
  depends on thread and network timing. A deterministic simulator turns every failure into a
  seed that replays exactly, and runs far more schedules per minute than real processes. The
  real-process tests in M10 then check that the simulator's model of the world was not lying.
  This is FoundationDB's simulation approach plus Jepsen's checking approach.

### D8: Name and location
- **What:** `spool`, at `~/Projects/spool`. The GitHub repo stays private until Tier 1 (M0–M4) is done.
- **Why:** short, not taken by a well-known queue, and a spool is a thing that holds work until
  it is consumed. Private until the single-node queue is correct and durable, as with the sibling projects.
